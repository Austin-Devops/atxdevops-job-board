## Introduction and Reasoning

First off, Hi :wave:, thanks for joining us here. We have
a [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that we all need to abide by. If you
feel any reason to be uncomfortable or something doesn't feel right please reach
out to the Help section below and we'll attend to it ASAP.

So, you've come here looking for a job in the DevOps Space. Awesome. We have a
specific reason why this repo exists. Hiring engineers with the correct passion
and skill set is hard. **REALLY HARD**. Jobs sometimes don't get filled for Months or
in some cases Years. The jobs either roll off or disappear through the other means
to find them, this is a little more "permanent."

Also, if you are looking at this level, you probably find your job through your network.
What is ATX DevOps then an amazing network for the ATX space. Thank you for being a part
of it.
