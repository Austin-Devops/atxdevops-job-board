## Introduction and Reasoning

First off, Hi :wave:, thanks for joining us here. We have
a (code of conduct)[./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md] that we all need to abide by. If you
feel any reason to be uncomfortable or something doesn't feel right please reach
out to the Help section below and we'll attend to it ASAP.

So, you've come here looking for a job in the DevOps Space. Awesome. We have a
specfic reason why this repo exists. Hiring engineers with the correct passion
and skill set is hard. REALLY HARD. Jobs sometimes don't get filled for Months or
in some cases Years. The jobs either roll off or disappear through the other means
to find them, this is a little more "permanent."

Also, if you are looking at this level, you probably find your job through your network.
What is ATX DevOps then an amazing network for the ATX space. Thank you for being a part
of it.

## Scope

**Location**: Austin "based". This could also mean a Resident of ATX, and remote. We want to
scope the location for people in the Austin Metro Area.

**Employment Range**: Most if not all are usually Senior or "very experienced" humans. They have
been in the industry a while and understand how to work in the modern day environments.
